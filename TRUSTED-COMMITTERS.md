# Trusted Committers

Trusted committers (TCs) are those members of our working group who have elevated rights and direct write access to this repository. *TCs act as stewards of the working group and community. They aim to make consensus-based decisions in the best interest of the working group.* They also act as the guardians of this repository: TCs react to, referee, and give feedback about incoming contributions.

## Process for Adding new Trusted Committers

We work based on trust: Our goal is to add most people who contributed a sizeable change - quick and early.

We follow this process (adapted from [here](https://tech.europace.de/voting-in-new-trusted-committers/)):

1. Any trusted committer (TC) can step forward and nominate a new TC in the private Slack channel #innersource-patterns-tcs. The TC should provide the following information:
   * Name of the candidate
   * Reason for candidate
   * Github handle of the candidate
   * Slack handle of the candidate
1. Every TC can raise concerns or second the nomination in the #innersource-patterns-tcs channel.
1. If none of the existing TCs disagrees with the nomination within 72h, [lazy consensus](https://tech.europace.de/lazy-consensus-vs-explicit-voting/) is reached: The nomination is accepted.
1. The TC who nominated the candidate informs her/him in private about the nomination and its acceptance. The candidate can decide on whether to accept or reject the offer.
1. If the candidate accepts the offer, the TC who nominated the candidate, makes sure:
   * New TC is added to this file
   * New TC receives write access to this repository
   * New TC is added to the #innersource-patterns-tcs channel
   * New TC is praised in the [#innersource-patterns](https://app.slack.com/client/T04PXKRM0/C2EFRTS6A) channel.


## Admins
A handful of individuals are currently the technical GitHub Admins for this repository. This includes most members of the InnerSource Commons' #tech-infra team and members of the [InnerSource Commons GitHub Organization](https://github.com/innersourcecommons). However, please channel working group-specific requests through the trusted committers.
