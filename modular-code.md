**Title:** ??  

**Statement of Problem:** Management does not want to spend the extra resources needed to develop modular components and make them available in a visible repository for others to use.  

**Context:** Assuming this is a new product/new code, not a legacy product.  

**Forces:**
Making code modular takes extra effort and time to develop.
There is a learning curve too:  learning how to write code so that it can be reused.
Extra documentation is needed too.
If you expose it, there is also the spectre of needing to provide support for it.  
Some companies have a common components group that develops reusable code, but others feel that such components should be developed by those business lines that are using the components and a library of common components could be established.

**Resolution:**  ?  
    - Provide incentives to teams to participate
    - Modular code is well-understood; there is a lot of literature in favor of this. Look there for reasons to modularize code.
    - Establish a checklist of elements to be checked off to classify a component as reusable
    - Select certain "success projects," teams that will develop reusable code and demonstrate the long term success

**Resulting Context:** Time is spent making the shared code modular so it can be shared.
