# THIS IS A SAMPLE PATTERN
IT IS HERE ONLY AS AN EXAMPLE AND IS NOT COMPLETE.  
[Please join us in reviewing this and other patterns](https://github.com/paypal/InnerSourcePatterns/pulls).

## Title
* junkyard styled inner sourcing
* Finding but deciding not to use the internal component

## Context
Two situations:

* SW component not designed for reuse because the schedule was too tight and did not allow for the extra effort needed
* Did not have the knowledge or training to create components that can b reused.

## Problem
* People don't share something so others can use it; they only share it for the sake of sharing. They wouldn't mind if no one uses it (a bit of a graveyard: "InnerSource is where modules go to die").

## Status
Brainstormed pattern idea in progress
